# Waste Identify and classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network
Final project for an application of machine learning and deep learning. 

# Project Overview
* This is all about to identify and classify and also provide the reuse ideas according to the waste
* The system will identify the cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash.
* Convolutional Neural Network is the model
* Dataset includes cardboard(393), glass(491), metal(400), paper(584), plastic(472), trash(127)

# The system builf with
* python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Java (Android Studio)
* Microsoft SQL server management studio

# Special note
* If you want to run the application you need to change the ip address that i put the ip address in my connection code (db service)

# GitHub Repository

# All libraries for ML
* tensorflow
* Sequential
* keras.layers
* ImageDataGenerator
* sklearn.metrics
* keras
* PIL
* pathlib
* scipy
* os
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* torchvisio.datasets
* torchvision.transform

# Results
The system will identify and classify all the waste successfully. In addition to that the system successfully provide the reuse details by gettin the data from MS SQL. 
How ever we have to optimize the ML model even more
